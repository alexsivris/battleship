# Battleship (game) #

This game was developed in 2015 during the block course C++ at TUM (Security in Information Systems). The details of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). The requirements for the implementation are:

*  Field size: 10x10 tiles
*  Four Ship types: Battleship (occupies 5 tiles), Cruiser (occupies 4 tiles), Destroyer (occupies 3 tiles), Sub-marine (occupies 2 tiles)
*  The player who first sinks down all of the opponent ships

Moreover, the game has to run over the network. Any other implementation of the game that follows the pre-defined network protocol should be able to interact with this implementation ([German version of the protocol](project/network_protocol.png)).
